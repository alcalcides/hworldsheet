# Then... Record! 

This began when I noticed that every new language used demand  effort to memorize its syntax and semantic rules. So, as I did not want carry my copybook forever, I decided record every new sentence in a simple text file full of comments (but not spamy) in order to I be able to come back wherever and reopen, seek the forgotten command, for example, and "Ctrl+C Ctrl+V".

## What about the struct
 
- A new discipline, programing language or whatever specific subject, a new folder in database. 
- If the subject has concepts, so there is a *topic.txt* file
- If the subject is a kind of coding, there is a folder named *sheet* with its *samples* and *comments*

## How this is growing up

- A new knowledge area learning, a new entity into database 
- A new concept or a deeper learning into coding, a new block of lines
